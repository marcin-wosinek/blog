# Hello World
I'm Marcin Wosinek \[MAR-chin vo-SHE-neck\]. I post here slides, notes and videos of IT presentations I'm giving. Some of post are in Polish.

## Topics
I'm really exicted about 'put more logic in broser js' trend so mostly I speak about that stuff. I enjoy AngularJs framework for it's wonderful testability, out of the box two way bindings and directive - therefor most of my presentations are somewhere around AngularJs. 

## Who am I?
Pozna≈Ñ, Poland based IT specialist; since January 2013 meetup an conference speaker and self proclaimed AngularJs evengelist.

## Contact
I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Especially if you:

* want to have my talk or workshop on a conference/meetup
* are interested in AngularJs training
