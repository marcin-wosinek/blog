# Handout
## Learning materials
* 50+ free videos covering basic and advanced stuff from angular: https://egghead.io/
* 25+ presenations form angularJs headquater: http://www.youtube.com/user/angularjs
* 25+ presentation form the first angular conference: http://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos
* official tutorial: http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial
* book:
 * **"AngularJS"** by Brad Green & Shyam Seshadri - basic (I've read and recommend)
 * **"Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS"** by Pawel Kozlowski \&
   Peter Bacon Darwin - advanced. Looks good because of author renome and good
   reviews, but I havn't read
* course on codecademy - http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-advanced-en-2hJ3J/0/1 . Only the very besics is ready

## Libraries
That I'm using:

* **angular-ui** http://angular-ui.github.io/ - pack of high quality components; eg.:
 * **bootstrap** - twitter bootstrap js rewritten in pure angular js
 * **ui-select2** - directive to integrate with select2 widget 
* **angular-nestedSortable** https://github.com/JimLiu/Angular-NestedSortable - sortable directive

That looks very promissing:

* **restangular** https://github.com/mgonto/restangular - rest library
* **routeSegment** http://angular-route-segment.com/ - when core routing is becoming not enough

Module directory: http://ngmodules.org/

## Tools
* **yeoman** http://yeoman.io/ - not just a tool, but a workflow
 * **yo** - code generator
 

## Bad practices

## Recommended uses
* admin pages
* pages available only for logged user
* intranet pages
All pages where we have a lot of forms.

## NOT recommended uses
* wikipedia clones: pages where is more content then interaction
* games
