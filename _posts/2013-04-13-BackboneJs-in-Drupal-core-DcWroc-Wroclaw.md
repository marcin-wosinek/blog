# BackboneJs in Drupal core
## How am I?
* Marcin Wosinek
* Currently js contractor in Poznań
* 1 year of working with d6 & d7
* 8 month after swithing completly into frontend js

## You?
* Who likes js?
* Who have bad experience with huge browserside js codebases?

## Why js matters?
* the power of js is rasing - more things can be developed with it
* different implementation have decent approach to standards
* rich ui in javascript offers better user experience

## Emerging pattern of back-front end relationship
* static js code - front end application
* templates done on browser side
* data get via rest form server

## Chalanges
* more code needs better code quality

## jQuery is not enouth
* jQuery is cool, but it's just DOM manipulation library 
* beside it we need some sollution for architecture

## Programming best practices in front end?
* in short - front end js is quite hacky
* unit tests are rare
* lack of design patterns and serious aproach to architecture

## Solution
* using frameworks

## Browserside js frameworks
* backbone
* angular
* ember
